# NFarT - Rails Marketplace

### Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
This Marketplace app aims to disrupt the cryptocurrency and NFT craze. While the premise of these digital assest revolving around decentralisation are very honourable, it is clearly seen that those in rich with resources are benefitting the most from such a platform. Additionally, the global pandemic has highlighted the time spent quarantined and isolated in confined spaces, leading to people moving into larger homes with more physical space to move around in. 

### Why is it a problem that needs solving?
**NFarT** hopes to bring back the surrealism of physical art, moving away from digital assets, to promoting creative endeavours to both relax and create for pleasure.
It can be daunting to learn a new skill, with an increasing focus on monetising hobbies and capitalising on any goods and services produced. However, **NFarT** hopes to disrupt this culture and mindset, instead promoting that any effort can be rewarded.
