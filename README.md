# NFarT - Rails Marketplace

### Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
This Marketplace app aims to disrupt the cryptocurrency and NFT craze. While the premise of these digital assest revolving around decentralisation are very honourable, it is clearly seen that those in rich with resources are benefitting the most from such a platform. Additionally, the global pandemic has highlighted the time spent quarantined and isolated in confined spaces, leading to people moving into larger homes with more physical space to move around in. 

### Why is it a problem that needs solving?
**NFarT** hopes to bring back the surrealism of physical art, moving away from digital assets, to promoting creative endeavours to both relax and create for pleasure.
It can be daunting to learn a new skill, with an increasing focus on monetising hobbies and capitalising on any goods and services produced. However, **NFarT** hopes to disrupt this culture and mindset, instead promoting that any effort can be rewarded.

### User stories for your app
Gertrude
I love crafting, sewing, knitting, quilting, etc. Except I always run out of fabric and yarn and can never be bothered finishing it. It makes me sad to see all these ideas unfinished but I can't finish them anymore. I would like to be able to sell them to other people who can finish them or do something with them so it's not wasted.

Bartholemew
I love painting. I'm not a good painter, but I do it because it sparks joy. I have more artworks than friends that I can pass them along to. I would love to find homes for them where they can be appreciated for what they are. Expressions of moments that have been captured.

Florence
I'm an heiress and widow living in my empty manor. I'm eccentric and like having unique art not for value because I'm filthy rich but because they remind me and my guests that I host at my lavish balls in my private estate about the diversity of life. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
